# MR1
This repository contains scripts that reproduce our query of [Snaptron](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/1/114/4101942) for samples from the GTEx project ranked in order of descending junction inclusion ratio (JIR) distinguishing transcripts NM_001531 and NM_001195000 of MR1. Refer to `queries.sh` for more information. NM_001531 is distinguished by two junctions, the sum of whose coverages we call A, and NM_001195000 is distinguished by one junction, whose coverage we call B. `ranked_gtex_output.tsv` contains the samples ranked in order of descending (A - B) / (A + B), which means that samples that overexpress NM_001531 compared to NM_001195000 are at the top, and samples that overexpress NM_001195000 compared to NM_001531.
